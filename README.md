‚óè	Developed a machine learning model to predict whether garment workers would meet productivity targets using a real-world dataset from the UCI repository. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, I engineered relevant features, addressed class imbalance, and trained several classification models including Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting & many more. I applied cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (using Grid Search method) & evaluated model performance using F1-score. The final best model achieved an F1-score of 0.87 and a ROC-AUC of 0.91, providing a robust and interpretable tool for workforce performance prediction and optimization.
